## Tips for ADHD-friendly sprints

- Work in 30‚Äì45 minute focused blocks, track progress by checking off subtasks.
- Start with one page end-to-end (e.g., user registration ‚Üí users hub) before branching out.
- Use small PRs (one component or one endpoint per PR).
- Daily sync: show what‚Äôs done vs blocked (2‚Äì3 quick bullets).

---

If you'd like, I can:

- Produce these as individual Issue markdown files (one per task) ready to paste, or
- Create the issues in GitHub for you (I‚Äôll need confirmation to run the create tool).

Would you like the individual issue files next (one file per issue), or shall I create the issues in the repo for you now?
